## 2. The bot's main functionality <a name="mainfunctionality"></a>

The bot enables the user to interact using both clickable buttons and text input, though the bot's ability to interpret is limited. The idea is that the user most of the times should be able to type instead of using the buttons, but the bot doesn't understand that many inputs and text input therefore often has to match the button precisesly. The bot has a few core features, these are:

- Register measurements

It is possible to register measurements such as blood pressure by using the bot. When registering measurements, the user can choose if he wants to use a guide that explains all the steps, or without a guide. The bot also has the ability to keep track of the users measurements, which measurements that already are done and which are left.

- Answer health control forms regarding their general health

It is possible to answer health control forms about the users general health.

- Ask questions

The user has the option to ask questions by using the bot's FAQ. This includes questions about the bot and about the user's health. Is is also possible to be redirected to 1177's website.

- Manage booking of consultation

It is possible to book a consultation by using the bot. 


- Manage notifications

By using the notification settings, it is possible to be notified about upcoming measurements or if the user has forgotten to measure any value in time.
